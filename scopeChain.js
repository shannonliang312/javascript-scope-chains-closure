/* ## Nesting

Scopes can be nested. Both Lexical and Block scopes can contain other scopes:

    function someFunc() {
      function inner() {
      }
    }

inner is a nested lexical scope inside the lexical scope of someFunc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    if (true) {
      while (false) {
      }
    }

The while is a nested block scope inside the block scope of if

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    function someFunc() {
      if (true) {
      }
    }

The if is a nested block scope inside the lexical scope of someFunc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Scoped Variable Access

All nested scopes follow the same rule: Each nested inner scope has access to
outer scope variables, but NOT vice-versa.

For example:

    function someFunc() {
      var outerVar = 1;
      function inner() {
        var innerVar = 2;
      }
    }

inner has access to both innerVar & outerVar, but someFunc only has
access to outerVar

## Multiple Nested Scopes

Nesting isn't limited to a single inner scope, there can be multiple nested
scopes, each of which adhere to the Scoped Variable Access rule above. With
one addition: sibling scopes are also restricted from accessing each other's
variables.

For example:

    function someFunc() {
      function inner() {
      }
      function inner2() {
      }
    }

inner & inner2 are both inner scopes of someFunc. Just as someFunc
cannot access inner's variables, inner cannot access inner2's variables
(and vice versa)

## Scope Tree

Looking at the nesting from top-down, a tree of scopes is formed.

This code

    function someFunc() {
      function inner() {
      }
      function inner2() {
        function foo() {
        }
      }
    }

Produces this tree

       someFunc()
           |
          / \
         /   \
        /     \
       ↓       ↓
    inner()  inner2()
               |
               ↓
             foo()

Remembering that inner scopes can access outer scope's variables, but not
vice-versa (foo() can access inner2()'s variables, and inner2() can access
someFunc()'s variables), then it makes more sense to look at the tree from
bottom-up, which forms a chain, also known as...

## Scope Chains

Looking from most inner to most outer scope forms a Scope Chain.

someFunc()
           ↑
            \
             \
              \
             inner2()
               ↑
               |
             foo()
 */

function foo() {
  var bar;
  function zip() {
    var quux;
  }
}
