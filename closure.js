/* # Closures

Closures are an important part of the Javascript language. They are what enables
the callback-last programming most prominent in node, and provide an excellent
mechanism for handling the asynchronous nature of most Javascript tasks.

To properly understand closures, let's start with an example scope chain:

    someFunc()
        ↑
        |
     inner()
        ↑
        |
      foo()

Let's say someFunc() declares a variable bar:

    someFunc()
     var bar
        ↑
        ⋮

Given how nesting scope works, it's possible for an inner scope within
someFunc() to access bar. In this example, let's say inner() accesses
bar:

    someFunc()
     var bar
        ↑
        |
     inner()
    alert(bar)
        ↑
        ⋮

Then inner() is said to Close Over bar. Therefore inner() is a Closure.

To power the callback style of programming, the closure will be maintained even
if inner() isn't executed immediately. It is perfectly legal in Javascript to
pass inner around / return it from someFunc() for later execution. All the
while, bar will continue to be available.
